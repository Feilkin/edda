# edda

Probably the worst scripting language, ever. Read [helloworld.edda](examples/helloworld.edda) and [traits.edda](examples/traits.edda) for examples.

Edda will probably be optionally typed, semi-functional scripting language written in Rust. At this point, it can do simple math. Oh, and it doesn't have a proper VM yet, but it should have one in the future.
