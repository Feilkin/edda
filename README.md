# edda

Probably the worst scripting language, ever. Read [helloworld.edda](examples/helloworld.edda) for example.

Edda will be statically typed language. I think. I'm not 100% sure yet. HM is hard.

## Running examples

You can run edda scripts with `cargo run --release -- <edda file>`.
I highly recommend running in release mode.
